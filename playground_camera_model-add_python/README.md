# playground_camera_model

Simple CMake based template for a common C++ project.

## Dependencies

The template is based on the following components:

* CMake
* boost
* googletest
* fmt
* libopencv-dev

For a Debian/Ubuntu system, run the following command to install the dependencies:

	sudo apt install \
		git \
		cmake \
		g++ \
		libfmt-dev \
		libboost-all-dev \
		libopencv-dev

GoogleTest is pulled in as a git submodule to avoid problems with missing cmake files in sub distributions.

## Usage

Clone, prepare and build with the following steps:

	git clone git@github.com:twyleg/playground_camera_model.git
	cd playground_camera_model

	git submodule update --init

	cd build/
	cmake ../
